# Software Engineering Process for the Bridge

## DeveWorkflows

### Setting up the repository for your project on GitHub

Bridge staff will generally create code repositories in the [MIT Quest GitHub Organization](https://github.com/mit-quest/) for the project your working on so contact them for which repository to use for your project. If you provide Bridge staff with your GitHub username they can add you to the repository. Please be mindful of if it is a public or private repository (this is especially true if sensitive items (such as data visualizations, plots, or IP addresses) are included in the repository). 

Generally, best practices are to not keep the following items in code repositories (and therefore not appear in the GitHub repository):
- data (raw or processed)
- access keys
- intermediate results
 
If you have any questions about what should or should not be stored in the code repository (either due privacy or to best practices reasons) contact your supervisor.

### Viewing the codebase on your local machine

[Set up SSH keys](./git.md#ssh_keys)

[Clone](./git.md#Clone) the code repository to your local machine (generally we find it's easiest to create a `repos` folder in your home directory and clone any repository from GitHub there).

Either point your favorite IDE to that folder or `cd` into it.


### Running the code in the repository


master always works

github docs
add/commit
issues/pull request doc
VM issues
data/buckets
Git local / git remote / github




What are the overall workflows?

I want to run the code in the repo as described by the README
- locally
- remote on a VM

I want to make significant changes to the code in the repo
- locally
- remote on a VM

I want to make minor edits to the code in the repo (reserved mainly for doc edits)

I want to store data in a Cloud Provider

I want to use data stored in a Cloud Provider

There's a bug I want someone (maybe me) to fix or a new thing I want the codebase to do!
